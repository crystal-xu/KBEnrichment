# LSR_BERT
It is the PyTorch implementation of the LSR model with BERT embeddings in ACL 2020 Paper 
"[Reasoning with Latent Structure Refinement for Document-Level Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06312)".

This repository adapted the authors' implementation of LSR with GloVe embeddings: https://github.com/nanguoshun/LSR/tree/master
